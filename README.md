# URLS - UI

**Simple UI on top of [urls-api](https://github.com/mvitz/urls-api)**

This is a simple UI on top of [urls-api](https://github.com/mvitz/urls-api). It
is used as an example in some of my trainings/talks to introduce/show some
logging concepts in a microservice system.

See the commits and the [urls-api](https://github.com/mvitz/urls-api) repository
for the complete example.
